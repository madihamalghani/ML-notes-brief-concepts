# NumPy Basic Introduction:
NumpyÂ is a Python library for creating and manipulating matrices, the main data structure used by ML algorithms.Â MatricesÂ are mathematical objects used to store values in rows and columns.

## **Issue in python without using NumPy Library?**

In simple Python (without using libraries like NumPy), arrays are typically represented using **lists**, which are inherently one-dimensional. However, you can create multi-dimensional arrays using **lists of lists**.

- In **pure Python**, lists are **naturally one-dimensional**.
- To create **multi-dimensional arrays**, you use **lists of lists**.

### Why use NumPy?

Python lists are **heterogeneous**, meaning they can hold elements of different data types, which is **not ideal for numerical computations**. Thatâ€™s one of the key reasons why we use **NumPy** for handling multi-dimensional numerical data efficiently. 

**Benefits of using NumPy:**

- NumPy takes less time to compile
- More optimized
- Deals with multi-dimensional arrays

**Python calls matricesÂ *lists*, NumPy calls themÂ *arrays*Â and TensorFlow calls themÂ *tensors*. Python represents matrices with theÂ list data type.**
